# 📌 PicoServer Changelog

PicoServer, as a Web capability glue library, is supported by lightweight HTTP server core capabilities, providing out-of-the-box and flexible extension capabilities, compatible with cross-platform and AOT compilation.

> Recommended to use the latest version of PicoServer for complete functionality. Minimalist design with no breaking changes, safe to upgrade.

## V1.7.6
- ➕ JWT authentication adds Token blacklist feature, supporting `Add`, `IsBlacklisted`, `Remove`, `CleanExpired` methods, enabling secure token revocation.
- ➕ `AddJwtTokenVerify` adds `CleanupIntervalMinutes` parameter to control blacklist auto-cleanup interval (minutes). Default is `0`, meaning no auto cleanup.

## V1.7.5
- ➕ `JwtHelper` adds new public method `VerifyToken(string token)`, complete JWT token validation (signature + exp), convenient for custom validation middleware.

## V1.7.4
- ➕ `AddStaticFiles` middleware adds automatic multi-level directory `index.html` matching. When accessing paths ending with `/`, automatically returns `index.html` under that directory.

## V1.7.3
- ➕ `WebSocket` server adds `WsCloseClientAsync` and `WsCloseAllClientsAsync` methods for server-initiated client disconnection.

## V1.7.2
- 🐛 Optimized timestamp functions `GetTimeStamp10` and `GetTimeStamp13` for better cross-language collaboration.

## V1.7.1
- 🐛 Fixed bug where `WsMaxConnections` and `enableWebSocket` were ineffective.

## V1.7
- ➕ `WebAPIServer` main class adds four semantic methods: `MapGet`, `MapPost`, `MapPut`, `MapDelete`, wrapped on top of `AddRoute` base method for better development experience.

## V1.6.5
- ➕ AddStaticFiles middleware adds built-in caching. Uses file fingerprint automatic verification to ensure synchronization when files change, while supporting strong cache duration settings, seamless switching between test and production environments.

## V1.6.4
- 🛠️ Optimization, further enhanced AddStaticFiles middleware native cross-platform security, secure by default, blocks access to hidden files (e.g., `.env`, `.git`, `.config`).

## V1.6.3
- 🛠️ Optimized AddStaticFiles middleware logic, falls back to route matching when no file matched, removed redundant parameters.
- ➕ AddStaticFiles middleware adds automatic URL decoding, supports Chinese and other paths.

## V1.6.2
- ➕ JWT validation middleware AddJwtTokenVerify adds automatic exp field validation. Built-in `GetTimeStamp10()` method for easy exp timestamp setting.

## V1.6.1
- 🛠️ Optimized WebSocket server subscription event parameter semantics, adapts to VS auto-generated parameter scenarios, improving development experience.
- 🛠️ Exposed `GetContentType` method for developers to directly call and get MIME type string based on file extension. Example: `GetContentType(".html")`.

## V1.6
🚀 Concept Upgrade:
- .NET App + PicoServer = Web-enabled App
- Industrial HMI + PicoServer = Web-manageable HMI
- Desktop App + PicoServer = Desktop Service with API
- Console App + PicoServer = Lightweight Independent Web Service
- Edge Device + PicoServer = Edge Node with Web Capabilities

> Your App + PicoServer = ?

- 🛠️ Several minor optimizations.

## V1.5.10
- ➕ New built-in static file server middleware `AddStaticFiles`, compatible with B/S architecture where Web frontend and WebAPI coexist (Example: `MyAPI.AddStaticFiles("/", "wwwroot", "/api/")`).
- 🛠️ Optimized response `SendFileAsync` method: `asAttachment` parameter default changed to `False`, no forced download by default.

## V1.5.9
- ➕ New built-in CORS middleware `AddCors()`, adapts to multi-scenario cross-domain requirements, easier Web development:
  - No parameter: automatically matches requesting frontend domain (only allows cross-domain from requesting frontend)
  - With parameter: only allows specified frontend (e.g., `AddCors("http://127.0.0.1:5500")`)
- ➖ Removed response `EnableCors` standalone method: cross-domain should be handled by global middleware (not per-response), no practical use case.

## V1.5.7
- ➕ New: automatic handling of HTTP OPTIONS preflight requests (returns 204 standard response).

## V1.5.6
- 🛠️ Enhanced built-in JWT middleware stability and security.

## V1.5.5
- 🛠️ Optimized AOT compilation support.
- 🛠️ Further performance optimization, faster wildcard matching, faster token validation, lower memory usage.
- 🐛 Fixed potential garbled characters when getting Chinese parameter values from URL query. Unified to UTF-8.

## V1.5.4
- ➕ NuGet package adds XML comments, improves IDE IntelliSense, boosts development efficiency.
- ➕ Request object adds six extension methods: `GetQuery`, `GetQuery<T>`, `ParseForm`, `ParseQuery`, `ReadBodyAsStringAsync`, `ReadBodyAsString`, simplifying GET query parameters and POST form parameters retrieval and parsing.

## V1.5.3
- ➕ For better recognition and long-term development, MicroServer is officially renamed to PicoServer. Only the name and root namespace are different, everything else is identical. Just replace the namespace with PicoServer to complete the migration.

> ❤ Official website upgraded to top-level domain picoserver.cn ❤ Thank you for your love and support.

## V1.5.2
- ➕ Response object adds `EnableCors` method for cross-domain support, default `*`, supports single domain setting. Provided by Alex Chow.

## V1.5.1
- 🛠️ Optimized wildcard matching, built-in simple token, JWT validation speed, significant performance improvement.

## V1.5.0
- ➕ Route adds `*` wildcard support (built-in anti-directory traversal), supports multiple wildcards but only one per URL segment. Implements `/api/*/posts` POST route format, matches `/api/xxx/posts` single-level wildcard requests.
- 🛠️ Optimized route internal structure and matching logic, significant performance improvement.

## V1.4.6
- 🛠️ Route values are case-insensitive, automatically converted to lowercase for storage and matching.

## V1.4.5
- ➕ New `IsRunning` property as service restart judgment, enabling safe service start/stop switch without exiting main program.
- 🐛 Fixed exception when restarting service after stopping. Thanks to Alex Chow for the feedback.

## V1.4.4
- ➕ Added Cookie operation extension methods (support add, delete, expire, etc.), provided by Alex Chow.
- 🐛 Optimized issues that may occur when calling from C#.
